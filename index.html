    This paper aims to investigate the potential usage of Black Holes as energy sources via the investigation of several theorised extraction 
    methods from multiple academic and research journals whereby the possibility of each technique was investigated. 
    Finding that according to the laws of physics and the inclusion of the quantum realm then it is realistic to be able to consider the usage of a
    Black Hole as an energy source. However, it was found that despite the possibility, plausibility is another issue due to unavailability at the current 
    time of the necessary technology which will need to be developed specifically for the use of extracting and storing the energy from a Black Hole.

       Space and the endless possibilities it holds have been of interest to humans for generations, opportunities offered by Black Holes have been at the 
      forefront of science since the discovery of the first black hole in 1971 <a href="index.html#Stuart">(Stuart,2024)</a>. The possibility of using Black Holes as an energy source in 
      the future has been greatly contested due to the complexity of the issues, with research into the problem rapidly occurring. Accounting for the
      necessary technological improvements, this paper will examine the viability of using Black Holes as energy sources and the future use they may provide by
      first inspecting the physical potential of the concepts and how this may be conducted, along with the efficiency of the currently theorised processes.

      Previous research conducted before the first appearance of the idea of using Black Holes as an energy source proved the possibility by discovering 
      an electric field around the event horizon of a Black Hole, which holds enough strength to allow for the creation of both electrons and positrons (Yirka,2023). 
      This allows for the first possible use of Black Holes as an energy source whereby primordial Black Holes [very small Black Holes with no spin (Yirka,2023) can be charged. 
      When particles are directed toward the centre, they become charged. It is possible to tell when fully charged as electrostatic forces will cause the particles to repel each 
      other (Yirka,2023).
         Research has been undertaken into looking at the application of the energy that could be extracted from Black Holes. There has been considerable research into 
      their usage as rechargeable batteries, nuclear reactors (Zhen-Feng.Run-Qiu,2023), and as an alternative electrical energy source like that of a wind 
      turbine (Cromb,2024). The most significant question posing the defining information on whether using Black Holes as energy sources is plausible is 
      how efficient energy transformations can be to justify the costs of technology production which will be needed. The efficiency has been calculated 
      according to both requirements if a Black Hole were to be used as a battery or also as a nuclear reactor. The efficiency may be 25% of the inputted 
      mass (Zhen-Feng.Run-Qiu,2023) for both potential outlooks however for rotating Black Holes a further parameter must be accounted for when analysing energy 
      efficiency. Research discovered that for rotating black holes “Energy efficiency depends on spin parameter” (Patel, V. Acharya, K. Bambhaniya, P. Joshi, P, 2022) when taking 
      a black hole and using the energy in a process of a battery it can “transform 25% of input mass into available electric energy in a controllable and slow way” (Zhen-Feng.Run-Qiu,2023), 
      which correlates to a possibility of becoming a powerful energy source for the world as a whole. If the technology required is created similarly it is also found that “as a nuclear reactor 
      transform 25% mass of alpha particle into kinetic energy of positrons” (Zhen-Feng.Run-Qiu,2023) which although not transformed into electrical energy of which earth could benefit; the kinetic 
      energy generated may be able to be utilised to create electrical energy via a generator system.
          Several processes to extract energy from Black Holes have been the subject of research namely: Zel’dovich amplification (Cromb, 2024), 
      the Penrose Process (Patel, V. Acharya, K. Bambhaniya, P. Joshi, P, 2022). All processes have been investigated and have been found to be possible and within the natural bounds of the physical world, 
      further improving the plausibility of utilising Black Holes in the future as a source of energy. 
Zel’dovich amplification was first theorised by Russian physicists in 1971, whereby electromagnetic waves scatter within a cylinder and are amplified as they 
      gain rotational energy (Dumé, 2024). Further research in the 21st century has found that if a cylinder absorbs electromagnetic waves they bounce and are 
      therefore amplified creating a negative resistance (Cromb, 2024) whereby they act like a generator inside of a wind turbine and hence like a power source 
      or battery. Within the same article further research was undertaken to link the effect to Black Holes, highlighting the potential of quantum theory within
      the same process to create matter with the amplification of waves, which could then be applied to extracting energy.
The Penrose process was originally formed as an alternative option to extricate energy from Black Holes (Almeida, 2021). It has further 
      been used as the most common answer to extracting rotational energy from regular Black Holes (Patel, V. Acharya, K. Bambhaniya, P. Joshi, P, 2022). 
      However, despite the process seemingly being the most suitable and realistic for future use as a way to allow Black Holes to become the energy sources 
      of the future, there are certain situations in which the Penrose process is not possible largely due to the requirement of the presence of an ergoregion 
      (region between the infinite redshift surface and the event horizon (Halstead, 2021) to be able to extract the rotational energy
      (Patel, V. Acharya, K. Bambhaniya, P. Joshi, P, 2022).Furthermore, the use of the Penrose process significantly improves the efficiency rate in regular 
      Black Holes (Patel, V. Acharya, K. Bambhaniya, P. Joshi, P, 2022),although still dependent on the spin parameter (Table 1)
